# **About**

I’m a crypto analyst, DeFi specialist, protocol investigator, and general crypto asset enthusiast with 3+ years of hands on crypto experience and deep research acumen. I previously worked as a cost engineer for Skanska on $100+ million dollar heavy civil construction projects **(2019-2021)**. I have an educational background at Virginia Tech with a Bachelor’s in Mechanical Engineering **(2019)**. 

Having bought my first satoshis in **2016**, the crypto space has since snowballed into an obsession of mine that always leaves me yearning for more. I have a deep understanding of crypto fundamentals and I am tapped into the ethos of the industry. Democratizing financial tools is a weighty, urgent, and honorable pursuit that I am constantly striving to be a part of.

I spend most of my time researching projects using crypto specific analytical tools, staying on top of new developments in the industry, and transacting across multiple blockchains. I have created and refined my own process for researching new projects and evaluating opportunities. I am continually synthesizing data and information into theses that I can later prove true or incorrect.

I am looking to bring my curiosity into a more structured environment with like minded people to help usher in a decade of decentralized, open, permissionless systems.
